## Hello!

I'm Sean ðŸ‘‹

I've been developing software in one way or another since 2014 and have been professionally developing software since March 2020 - what a month to start!!

So far, I've worked across the Pharmaceutical, Insurance and Geospatial Data industries. My travels have taken me from Dorset Software to First Databank UK and settled at an agri-tech company.

### The Technical Stuff

I'm flexible with paradigms - OOP, functional, procedural and so on. But I heavily believe in writing the test first (TDD). And better still, writing behavioural tests first (Behavioural TDD). You'll see my portfolio is full of this. I want to press a button that tells me if everything works and trust it. Anything less means we have work to do.
I prefer pair programming and trunk-based development, given the choice.

I place a strong emphasis on CI/CD and have most Cloud experience in Azure with DotNet. But I can do whatever needs doing really. I view myself as a T-shaped developer that delivers vertical slices of product-focused features rather than horizontally-sliced components of features (backend only/frontend only/infrastructure only etc).

### The Non-Technical Stuff

I have too many hobbies. 

Currently, I'm focused on training for swimming twice a week (my coach pushes me too much!) and have some upcoming open-water swims.

Otherwise, I've been known to:
- Golf
- Surf
- Arduino
- Get wound up playing Elden Ring
- Fish
- Go clay disc shooting
- Fall off bikes
